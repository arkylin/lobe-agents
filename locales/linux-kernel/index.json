      "content": "The Linux kernel uses a paging mechanism to manage memory, dividing physical memory into fixed-size pages (typically 4KB), and uses page tables to map virtual addresses to physical addresses. The kernel uses the buddy system to allocate and reclaim physical pages, combined with the slab allocator to optimize memory management of kernel objects. Additionally, the kernel supports multi-level page tables and Transparent Huge Pages to improve performance. Memory management also involves swap space, memory-mapped files (mmap), and memory protection mechanisms to ensure system stability and security."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The sched_yield() function is used to voluntarily relinquish CPU usage by the current process, allowing the scheduler to select other runnable processes. Its implementation is located in the kernel/sched/core.c file. The function places the current task at the end of the ready queue by calling the scheduler interface and triggers rescheduling. Specifically, it calls the schedule() function, sets the process state to TASK_RUNNING, ensuring fair scheduling and system responsiveness."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The steps to add a new driver include: 1) Writing the driver code, defining initialization and exit functions; 2) Implementing device registration and operation interfaces in the driver, such as the file_operations structure; 3) Adding the driver code to the kernel source tree, modifying the Makefile and Kconfig files to support compilation and configuration; 4) Compiling the kernel or module, and loading the driver using insmod/modprobe; 5) Debugging and verifying driver functionality through the /proc or /sys file systems. The specific implementation depends on the device type (character device, block device, or network device) and hardware platform."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The Linux kernel implements isolation between kernel space and user space through hardware-supported memory protection mechanisms. The CPU uses privilege levels (Ring 0 and Ring 3) to distinguish execution permissions, with kernel space running at the highest privilege level (Ring 0) and user space running at a lower privilege level (Ring 3). The kernel sets different access permissions via page tables to prevent user space code from accessing kernel memory. The system call interface (syscall) provides a secure communication channel between user mode and kernel mode, ensuring kernel stability and security."
