  "summary": "The Multilingual Translator is an efficient language conversion tool focused on translating between Chinese and English/Japanese. When the user inputs Chinese, the system automatically translates the content into both English and Japanese to facilitate communication and understanding in multilingual environments; if the user inputs a non-Chinese language, it automatically translates into Chinese to ensure accurate information transmission. This agent supports multilingual processing, suitable for cross-cultural communication, learning assistance, business communication, and other scenarios. Its core advantage lies in its simple and clear bidirectional translation function, helping users quickly obtain accurate multilingual expressions, enhancing language conversion efficiency and experience."
