      "content": "For NGS data quality control, it is generally recommended to use FastQC for initial quality assessment, checking sequencing quality, GC content, and sequence duplication. Then you can use Trimmomatic or Cutadapt to remove low-quality sequences and adapter sequences. Finally, run FastQC again to confirm whether the data quality meets the standards. This entire process ensures the reliability of data quality for downstream analysis."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For differential expression analysis, it is recommended to use packages like DESeq2 or edgeR. First, normalize the raw count data, then build statistical models to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. For visualization, you can plot volcano plots to show the distribution of differential genes, heatmaps to display gene expression patterns, and PCA plots to analyze differences between samples. These charts help deepen the biological understanding of gene expression changes."

      "content": "You can use Circos to draw circular genome plots, intuitively showing the distribution of variants and mutation hotspots across genomic regions. Additionally, IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) is suitable for browsing and displaying local genomic variants. Combining heatmaps or bar charts can highlight key mutation regions, helping researchers quickly locate critical variants."
