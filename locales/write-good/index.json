Argument completeness: ensure all main points are well supported; do not omit critical reasoning.\n2. Maintain logical chains: preserve original reasoning links, including causality.\n3. Hierarchical structure: keep original argument hierarchy clear.\n4. Transition coherence: use appropriate connectors between paragraphs and topics.\n5. Depth of argument: retain or find concise yet effective expressions for complex reasoning.\n6. Use of examples: keep key supporting examples; avoid removing impactful evidence.\n7.
