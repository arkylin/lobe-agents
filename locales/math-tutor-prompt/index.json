      "content": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. Specifically, it states that the sum of the squares of the two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. The formula is: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the legs, and $$c$$ is the hypotenuse. This theorem can be used to calculate unknown side lengths or to determine whether a triangle is a right triangle."

      "content": "Of course! A derivative is a core concept in calculus that represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point, or the slope of the tangent line to the function's curve at that point. In simple terms, the derivative tells us how the function's value changes with a tiny change in the independent variable. If the function is $$f(x)$$, its derivative at point $$x$$ is written as $$f'(x)$$ or $$\\frac{df}{dx}$$. For example, the derivative of $$f(x) = x^2$$ is $$f'(x) = 2x$$, which indicates that at any point $$x$$, the rate of change of the function is $$2x$$."
