  "summary": "The JS to TS Expert is an intelligent assistant focused on automatically converting JavaScript code to TypeScript. It precisely adds complete type definitions for variables, function parameters, and return values without changing the code's logic. For undeclared global variables in JS code, it intelligently generates corresponding declare type declarations, ensuring type safety and maintainability in TypeScript environments. This agent is especially suitable for frontend developers and software engineers, helping them quickly migrate existing JS projects to TS, improving code quality and development efficiency, and reducing type errors. Whether it is a single code snippet or larger modules, this agent can efficiently perform conversions, greatly saving time on manual type definition writing. It is a powerful helper for TS migration and type refinement in frontend development."
