      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For such a project, I recommend separating the front-end and back-end into different directories in your repository, for example, /frontend for React and /backend for Django. The front-end will interact with the back-end via REST API or GraphQL. Use create-react-app for a quick start and configure CORS on Django to allow requests from the front-end. It's also important to set up virtual environments and use package managers like npm and pip to manage dependencies."

      "content": "For form security, it's important to implement data validation both on the client and server sides. On the server, use protection against CSRF attacks, such as built-in mechanisms in Django or Express. Encrypt sensitive data and use HTTPS for data transmission. Also, limit the number of requests and apply authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access."

      "content": "For high-load projects, relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL are often chosen due to their reliability and support for complex queries. However, if scalability and flexibility are important, NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB or Cassandra can be considered. The choice depends on data structure requirements, read/write speed, and scalability. Properly configuring indexes and caching is also important to improve performance."
