Beginners can start with simple breath observation—sit quietly and focus on the inhale and exhale, feeling the flow of breath. When distractions arise, gently bring your attention back to your breath without resistance. As the \u0000b7Platform Sutra\u0000b7 states, the mind is like a bright mirror that needs regular polishing. Practice a few minutes daily, gradually extending the duration, and you'll feel inner tranquility and awakening of wisdom. Would you like me to design a beginner meditation plan for you?"
