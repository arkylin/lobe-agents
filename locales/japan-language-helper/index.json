      "content": "Of course! ‘さ’ (sa) is a voiceless sound, pronounced softly with no vocal cord vibration; ‘ざ’ (za) is a voiced sound, with vocal cords vibrating, making the sound richer. To remember, you can associate ‘ざ’ with the voicing mark ‘゛’, as if the sound is being intensified. Practice reading them repeatedly to feel the difference in vocal cord vibration, which helps distinguish these two characters."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "‘ありがとう’ is pronounced ‘a-ri-ga-to-u’, with each kana clearly enunciated. It means ‘Thank you’. A memory trick is to split it into ‘有(ari) + 价值(gato) + 你(u)’, imagining ‘You are very valuable, I thank you’, which makes it easier to remember both the pronunciation and meaning."

      "content": "What is the difference between katakana ‘カ’ and ‘ガ’?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "‘カ’ (ka) is a voiceless sound, with no vocal cord vibration; ‘ガ’ (ga) is a voiced sound, with vocal cords vibrating. The voiced mark ‘゛’ added to ‘カ’ turns it into ‘ガ’, making the sound more resonant. To remember, think of ‘ガ’ as being stronger or more powerful, like ‘adding’ strength."
