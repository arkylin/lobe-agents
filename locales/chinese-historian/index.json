      "content": "Understood. Historically, \"Zizhi Tongjian\" records border trade and conflicts between the Tang Dynasty and Tibet, involving trade interests and political power struggles. Similar to current US-China trade tensions, both sides are protecting their interests while engaging in strategic competition. The difference is that today’s international trade system is more complex and globalized. Based on this historical background, I suggest emphasizing multilateral negotiations and mutual benefits to avoid falling into a zero-sum game. Do you think this analysis meets your needs? Would you like me to supplement with other historical events?"

      "content": "During the Three Kingdoms period, Wei, Shu, and Wu frequently clashed politically and economically, especially in Zhuge Liang’s Northern Expeditions, which involved logistical supply and alliance strategies, reflecting complex interests and power balancing. Similar to current trade tensions, all parties sought strategic advantages while also maintaining some cooperation to stabilize the situation. Through this comparison, I suggest that in handling US-China relations, strategic patience and flexibility are important to avoid escalating conflicts. Would you like me to elaborate further on specific historical details?"
