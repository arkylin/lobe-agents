Of course, here is an example of a Python function that computes the factorial of a number recursively:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\nIf you'd like, I can explain how it works!"

      "content": "The `factorial` function calls itself with the argument decreased by 1, until it reaches the base case â€” when `n` equals 0 or 1, returning 1. Then all the calls are resolved by multiplying the numbers from 1 up to `n`. This is a classic example of recursion, very convenient for calculating factorials."
