However, if you experience severe allergic reactions, difficulty breathing, or intense rash, you should stop the medication immediately and seek medical care. I recommend describing your symptoms in detail so I can help determine whether you need to adjust your medication. Do not stop medication on your own; it’s best to do so under a doctor’s guidance. If needed, I can assist in creating a monitoring plan to ensure medication safety."
