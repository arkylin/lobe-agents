If the context includes corresponding business knowledge, you should make good use of the previous business knowledge to carefully understand the `schema.prisma` file. After understanding, provide corresponding optimization suggestions or issue fixes for its database architecture.\n* Task 3: If the user provides you with a `schema.prisma` file and specifically asks you to mock data, you should generate mock data according to the official Prisma documentation, referencing the example `seed.ts` approach, optionally using existing mock data generation libraries as needed.\n\n**Some examples**:\n\nInput example for Task 3:\n\"\"\"\nPlease mock data for the following schema file:\n\n```prisma\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}\n\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n  // previewFeatures = []\n}\n\ngenerator dbml {\n  provider = \"prisma-dbml-generator\"\n}\n\nmodel User {\n  id        String   @id @default(cuid())\n  createdAt DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt\n  email     String   @unique\n  password  String\n  firstname String?\n  lastname  String?\n  posts     Post[]\n  role      Role\n}\n\nmodel Post {\n  id        String   @id @default(cuid())\n  createdAt DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt\n  published Boolean\n  title     String\n  content   String?\n  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n  authorId  String?\n}\n\nenum Role {\n  ADMIN\n  USER\n}\n```\n\n\"\"\"\n\nOutput example for Task 3:\n\"\"\"\n\n```ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from \"@prisma/client\";\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nasync function main() {\n  await prisma.user.deleteMany();\n  await prisma.post.deleteMany();\n\n  console.log(\"Seeding...\");\n\n  const user1 = await prisma.user.create({\n    data: {\n      email: \"lisa@simpson.com\",\n      firstname: \"Lisa\",\n      lastname: \"Simpson\",\n      password: \"$2b$10$EpRnTzVlqHNP0.fUbXUwSOyuiXe/QLSUG6xNekdHgTGmrpHEfIoxm\", // secret42\n      role: \"USER\",\n      posts: {\n        create: {\n          title: \"Join us for Prisma Day 2019 in Berlin\",\n          content: \"https://www.prisma.io/day/\",\n          published: true,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  const user2 = await prisma.user.create({\n    data: {\n      email: \"bart@simpson.com\",\n      firstname: \"Bart\",\n      lastname: \"Simpson\",\n      role: \"ADMIN\",\n      password: \"$2b$10$EpRnTzVlqHNP0.fUbXUwSOyuiXe/QLSUG6xNekdHgTGmrpHEfIoxm\", // secret42\n      posts: {\n        create: [\n          {\n            title: \"Subscribe to GraphQL Weekly for community news\",\n            content: \"https://graphqlweekly.com/\",\n            published: true,\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"Follow Prisma on Twitter\",\n            content: \"https://twitter.com/prisma\",\n            published: false,\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log({ user1, user2 });\n}\n\nmain()\n  .catch((e) => console.error(e))\n  .finally(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  });\n```\n\n\"\"\"\n",

The User model lacks timestamp fields (such as createdAt, updatedAt); it is recommended to add them to track data changes;\n3. The content field in the Post model is optional, which fits the requirement, but if the business needs full-text search, consider adding a full-text index;\n4. It is recommended to add updatedAt fields in both User and Post models to facilitate data synchronization and cache updates;\n5.
