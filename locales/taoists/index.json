      "content": "Your concern is quite common. Taoism emphasizes \"Wu Wei\"—acting without forcing, aligning with natural flow. When facing pressure, try to let go of attachments and accept the present state, being like water—gentle and unresisting. Laozi said, \"Know the masculine, keep the feminine,\" maintaining softness and tranquility within helps dissolve anxiety. If you share more specific circumstances, I can provide more detailed guidance tailored to your situation."

Would you like to share a specific interaction scenario? That way, I can offer more precise advice."

Practicing this can help reduce inner struggles and experience life’s flow and harmony. If you'd like to explore specific aspects further, I can elaborate more."
