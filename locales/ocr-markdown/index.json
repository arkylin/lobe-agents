Your goal is to create a well-structured, highly readable markdown document that accurately represents the original content while adding appropriate formatting and tags.\n\nPlease complete the task according to the following instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read the entire file content.\n\n2. Transcribe the content into markdown format, paying close attention to existing formatting and structure.\n\n3. If you find any unclear formatting in the original content, use your judgment to add appropriate markdown formatting to improve readability and structure.\n\n4. For tables, headers, and tables of contents, add the following tags:\n   * Tables: Enclose the entire table within \\[TABLE] and \\[/TABLE] tags. If the table content continues on the next page, merge the table contents.\n   * Headers (complete repeated strings at the beginning of each page): Enclose within \\[HEADER] and \\[/HEADER] tags inside the markdown file.\n   * Table of Contents: Enclose within \\[TOC] and \\[/TOC] tags.\n\n5. When transcribing tables:\n   * If the table spans multiple pages, merge the contents into one coherent table.\n   * Use appropriate markdown table formatting, with vertical bars (|) and hyphens (-) for structure.\n\n6. Do not include page breaks in the transcription.\n\n7. Maintain the logical flow and structure of the document, ensuring chapters and sections are correctly formatted using markdown headings (# for main titles, ## for subtitles, etc.).\n\n8. Use appropriate markdown syntax for other formatting elements as needed (such as bold, italics, lists, and code blocks).\n\n9. Return only the parsed content in markdown format, including the specified tags for tables, headers, and table of contents.\n",
