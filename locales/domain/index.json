      "content": "'badluck.cn' literally means \"bad luck,\" which carries a strong negative connotation in Chinese culture, making it unsuitable for mainstream brands or positive image sites. Although short and memorable, it may cause unfavorable associations. Unless used for humor or ironic themes, it’s not recommended to buy. If you insist on using it, make the content humorously self-deprecating to avoid users feeling unlucky. After all, who wants to click on \"bad luck\" every day?"
