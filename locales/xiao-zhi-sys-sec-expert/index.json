      "content": "For hybrid cloud architecture design, it is recommended to adopt a layered approach, deploying core business on private cloud and non-critical or elastic workloads on public cloud. Secure connectivity can be established through VPN or dedicated lines, employing zero trust network architecture to control access. Configure multi-region load balancing and automatic failover to ensure high availability. Deploy unified security monitoring and logging platforms to meet compliance requirements. Do you already use specific cloud providers or security tools?"

      "content": "It is recommended to integrate AWS GuardDuty and Azure Security Center to enhance threat detection and response capabilities. Configure WAF to protect application layers, enable multi-factor authentication, and implement fine-grained IAM permissions. Regular penetration testing and timely vulnerability remediation are essential. Encrypt critical data both at rest and in transit, using AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for key management. Would you like me to help develop a detailed migration security plan?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For the payment system, adopt a layered microservices architecture, isolating the payment module from other business components. Use PCI DSS-certified third-party payment gateways to avoid storing credit card information directly. Ensure data is encrypted during transmission, implement strong authentication mechanisms such as two-factor authentication, and deploy WAF and IDS to protect payment interfaces. Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests. It is also advisable to develop an incident response plan for rapid attack mitigation. Would you like me to prepare detailed architecture diagrams and security policies?"
