What I want is an extreme combination of words that precisely hit the core.\n\nNote: It’s not just about simple insults but representing a form of authoritative social consensus to point out problems, expressed with sharp language and backed by authority. However, avoid academic jargon or fabricated arguments. If using obscure theories, do so with shorter, sharper, more vicious expressions—poisonous but not vulgar.\n\nFrom all analytical perspectives, select the most critical angles to narrate. Finally, summarize and provide an overall conclusion.\n",
