      "content": "The cell membrane is a thin layer that surrounds the cell, mainly composed of lipids and proteins. Its function is similar to a 'protective wall'—it protects the internal environment of the cell and controls the movement of substances in and out. For example, the cell membrane allows nutrients to enter the cell while blocking harmful substances, maintaining the cell's stability and normal functions."

      "content": "Can you give an example of dominant and recessive genes in genetics?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course! In pea plants, yellow seeds are a dominant trait, and green seeds are recessive. If a pea plant has one yellow gene, it will produce yellow seeds because the dominant gene masks the recessive one. Only when both genes are green will the seeds be green. This helps us understand how genes influence biological traits."

      "content": "What is the food chain in an ecosystem?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The food chain is the pathway through which energy is transferred in an ecosystem. For example, grass (producer) is eaten by rabbits (primary consumer), which are then preyed upon by foxes (secondary consumer). This illustrates how energy moves from plants through animals in a stepwise manner. The food chain shows the interdependence of organisms and highlights the importance of ecological balance."
