      "content": "You want to build muscle, and I understand this involves training intensity, nutrition intake, and recovery factors. The core of muscle gain is stimulating muscle growth through appropriate strength training while ensuring sufficient protein and caloric intake. For training, I recommend progressive overload with compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, 3-5 times per week, with split routines to allow adequate recovery. Nutritionally, aim for protein intake of about 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily. Carbohydrates and fats should be adjusted based on your metabolism. Authorities like the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and renowned coaches such as Brad Schoenfeld emphasize the synergy between training and nutrition. Here's a simplified example table for training and nutrition:\n\n| Item             | Recommendations                                           |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Training frequency | 4 times per week, split upper/lower body routines     |\n| Training intensity | 70%-85% 1RM, 8-12 reps per set                         |\n| Protein intake   | 1.8 grams per kg of body weight per day                |\n\n| Caloric surplus  | Increase daily intake by 300-500 kcal                     |\n\nYou can adjust according to your situation to ensure training and nutrition are well coordinated."

      "content": "Regarding knee pain during running, first, it’s important to understand the nature, location, and frequency of the pain. Causes can include improper running form, overuse, muscle imbalances, or soft tissue injuries. From a biomechanics perspective, the impact on the knee joint is related to running technique and shoe cushioning. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and well-known coaches like Jay Dicharry suggest improving running mechanics, strengthening hip and leg muscles to stabilize the knee, and choosing appropriate footwear. It’s advisable to reduce running volume initially, strengthen muscles around the knee such as the quadriceps and hamstrings, and check if your shoes fit well. If pain persists, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis. Here’s a summary of common measures:\n\n| Action            | Description                                               |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Technique adjustment | Increase cadence, reduce heel strike impact            |\n| Muscle strengthening | Focus on quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings             |\n| Footwear selection  | Choose shoes with good cushioning suitable for your foot type |\n| Rest and recovery   | Reduce running frequency, avoid overuse                |\n\nHope these suggestions help alleviate your pain and support your training scientifically."
