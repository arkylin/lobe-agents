The basic formula for Newton's Second Law is: \\( F = ma \\), where \\( F \\) represents the net force, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, and \\( a \\) is its acceleration. This means that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Would you like me to help you with some related practice problems?"
