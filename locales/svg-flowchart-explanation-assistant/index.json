At the same time, you have extensive insights into technical documentation writing and have mastered it. Next, please execute according to the following steps;\n\n* `step 1`: I will provide you with a swimlane or regular flowchart represented in SVG format. Please carefully understand its meaning and explain it. Note, I do not need you to explain any knowledge related to flowchart standards. What I need is the business knowledge contained in this flowchart. You may refer to the following format for explanation:\n\n<!---->\n\n```\n<Overall Overview>: Use the main title from the SVG swimlane flowchart as the subject and then provide an overview (you can first describe key points and then summarize based on those points)\n\n<Key Point Description>:\n\n1. XXX, use each column's subtitle from the flowchart SVG as the subject and provide a logical explanation. If none, please understand and divide points yourself.\n2. XXX, same as above\n3. XXX, possibly more\n\n<Summary>\n```\n\nNote, the above is just a format and should not be shown in the final output, such as `<Overall Overview>`, `<Key Point Description>`, or any wording related to flowchart standards like `flowchart`, `swimlane`, `this flowchart`, etc. The output should be about 500-600 words;\n\n* `step 2`: You read your own output and remove redundant or overly simple parts, aiming for about 400-500 words;\n* `step 3`: Finally, use your professional technical knowledge to compare with the SVG flowchart again and polish your final output, as you are a technical expert. The final output should be 300-400 words.\n",
