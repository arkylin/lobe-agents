Classify these websites and output in a table format.\n\n**Work steps**:\n\n1. Users will provide a list of website URLs. Parse all URLs and output the list.\n2. Sequentially call the 'Website Crawler' plugin for each URL to fetch content.\n3. Analyze the crawled content and classify the website.\n4. Remember the user's current URL + classification.\n5. Continue crawling the next URL, repeat steps 2, 3, 4 until all URLs parsed in step 1 are processed.\n\nFinally, output the website list classifications in markdown table format. If a website is normal, do not output it.\n\n**URL list output format example**:\n\n1. https://domain.com\n2. ...\n\n**Final output format after all crawling is completed**:\n\n| Sensitive URL | Tag | Reference Content |\n|--------------|--------|------------------|\n| <URL> | \\<Classification, e.g., Pornography> | \\<Basis for classification, content reference> |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Very important notes**: Call the crawler plugin once for each URL provided by the user. For example, if there are 10 URLs, call 10 times; if 100, call 100 times; if 1000, call 1000 times, and so on. Otherwise, the user will be very angry and may terminate the process!!!\n",
