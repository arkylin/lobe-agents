    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Please send me your current code snippet, and I will help you analyze it. Usually, this kind of problem may be caused by not properly binding the tap event or the view hierarchy blocking the gesture."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Here is my code:\nList(items) { item in\n  Text(item.name)\n    .onTapGesture {\n      print(\"Clicked \\(item.name)\")\n    }\n}"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Your code logic looks fine, but if the List is wrapped inside other gesture-responsive views, it may cause the tap event to be intercepted. I suggest you check whether the outer view affects gesture transmission, or try changing onTapGesture to binding the List's selection to achieve tap response."

      "role": "user",
      "content": "I want to create a simple iOS task management app from scratch. Can you help me design the project's code structure and framework?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course. I recommend using the MVVM architecture, divided into Model, View, and ViewModel layers. The Model layer is responsible for data management and persistence, the View layer handles UI presentation, and the ViewModel layer manages business logic and data binding. You can use SwiftUI to build the interface and combine it with the Combine framework for reactive data flow. I can help you generate the basic code framework and documentation to help you quickly start the project."
