      "content": "The key to designing excavation support structures is ensuring stability of the excavation and safety of the surrounding environment. When determining the depth of support piles, considerations include soil properties, groundwater conditions, and excavation depth. Generally, support piles need to penetrate weaker soil layers and reach stronger soil or bedrock layers to provide sufficient lateral support. Calculations often involve soil pressure theories combined with limit equilibrium methods, such as: $$ H = \frac{\\sigma_s}{\\gamma} $$, where $H$ is the pile depth, $\\sigma_s$ is the soil layer's bearing capacity, and $\\gamma$ is the soil unit weight. If you can tell me your specific geological conditions and excavation dimensions, I can help with more detailed calculations and analysis."
