For memory techniques, you can break it down into 'meti-' similar to 'metal' (hard and detailed), and '-culous' which can be associated with 'careful'. Imagine a person as tough and detailed as metal, which helps to remember its meticulous meaning."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "'Resilient' refers to being elastic, able to recover quickly, often used to describe people or objects that can bounce back after pressure or difficulties. A memorization tip is to think of 're-' meaning 'again', and 'silient' sounding like 'silent'. Imagine someone who, after being silent or quiet, recovers and regains strength, which helps to remember its connotation of toughness and recovery."
