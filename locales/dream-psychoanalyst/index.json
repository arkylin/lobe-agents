The bottomless black hole represents subconscious anxieties and uncertainties that are difficult to control, making you feel helpless and lost. Your subconscious may be reminding you that, when facing real-life pressures, your fears are gradually accumulating. I suggest confronting these fears, seeking support and a sense of security; also, practices like journaling or meditation can help alleviate inner anxiety. Do you feel this analysis resonates with your actual feelings? If you're not satisfied, we can explore further. Have you recently experienced situations where you felt out of control?"

Your subconscious is expressing doubts about your abilities and anxiety through the dream. I recommend breaking down your work tasks, setting achievable small goals, and gradually building confidence; also, sharing your stress with colleagues or friends can provide emotional support. Do you feel that the main sources of your current stress are related to specific aspects? We can continue exploring ways to alleviate it. Would you like to discuss your ideal work situation?"
