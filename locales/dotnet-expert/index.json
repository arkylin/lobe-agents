      "content": "Certainly. First, I recommend checking whether appropriate query projection (Select) is used to avoid loading unnecessary data. Secondly, ensure asynchronous queries are enabled to improve response speed. Additionally, consider using raw SQL or Dapper to handle complex queries, reducing EF Core overhead. You can share the specific query code, and I can analyze it and provide optimization suggestions."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Your query uses Include to load related Orders, but if the number of Orders is large, it may cause performance degradation. It is recommended to use explicit loading or paged queries to limit the data volume, such as loading only recent orders or loading data in batches. Also, ensure the database has appropriate indexes to support the queries. You can also try projection queries that select only the required fields to avoid loading entire entities."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course. The key to microservices architecture design is to split the system into multiple independent services, each responsible for a single business function. It is recommended to use ASP.NET Core to build services, deploy them using Docker containers for flexible scaling. Inter-service communication can use RESTful APIs or message queues (such as Azure Service Bus). For databases, try to achieve database isolation, with each microservice managing its own data storage. Also consider non-functional requirements such as service discovery, load balancing, and logging and monitoring. I can help you detail the design plan to ensure the architecture is robust and maintainable."
