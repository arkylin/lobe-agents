  "summary": "This agent specializes in efficiently converting Docker run commands into Docker Compose YAML configuration files, assisting system operations engineers and developers in quickly setting up container orchestration configurations. Users only need to provide standard Docker run commands, and the agent will parse parameters such as environment variables, port mappings, volume mounts, and generate compliant Docker Compose files. This tool is particularly useful for multi-container management, environment setup, and automated deployment scenarios, improving operational efficiency and configuration accuracy. It serves as a bridge between single-container startup and multi-container orchestration. The core advantage lies in rapid, precise command-to-YAML conversion, reducing learning costs and configuration time."
